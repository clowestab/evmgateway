     * This function allows the contract to be queried for the support of specific interfaces defined
     * by their unique four-byte identifier. It serves as an override for the same function in several
     * parent contracts (Multicallable, AddrResolver, TextResolver, ABIResolver, ContentHashResolver, DNSResolver, NameResolver).
     *
     * The contract inheriting this function should implement the `supportsInterface` function
     * in all the parent contracts and return true if any of them supports the specified interface.
     * Otherwise, it returns false if none of the parent contracts support the interface.
     *
     * Example Usage:
     * ```
     * // Assuming `contractInstance` is an instance of the contract containing this function
     * bytes4 interfaceId =  L2PublicResolver.supportsInterface.selector
     * bool isSupported = contractInstance.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
